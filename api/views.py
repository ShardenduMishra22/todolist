# Rest Framework
## Django REST Framework is a tool for building APIs in Django. 
## It helps serialize data, handle authentication, manage permissions, validate input, and create routes for your API endpoints.
## It simplifies working with data and provides features like pagination, error handling, and easy testing for APIs.

# Django built-in User
## django.contrib.auth.models.User is Django's built-in user model used for managing authentication, user profiles, and user-related data. 
## You can customize and extend this model as needed for your application.


# 1. UserSerializer:
# - This serializer is used for serializing and deserializing Django's built-in User model.
# - class Meta: specifies which model (User) and fields (id, username, and password) are included.
# - extra_kwargs customizes field behavior:
#     - The password field is marked as write_only, meaning it will not be exposed in the API response, only used for creation or updates.
# - create(validated_data): is a method used to handle the creation of a new user. It uses create_user() method to create the user.

# 2. NoteSerializer:
# - This serializer is used for serializing and deserializing the Note model.
# - class Meta: specifies the Note model and the fields (id, title, content, created_at, and author) to be included in the serialization.
# - extra_kwargs sets author field as read-only, meaning it wonâ€™t accept input and will only display in API responses.


# 1. IsAuthenticated:
# -   This permission class allows access only to authenticated users.
# -   If the user is not authenticated (i.e., not logged in), the request is denied.
# -   Used when you want to restrict access to authenticated users only.

# 2. AllowAny:
# -   This permission class allows access to everyone, regardless of authentication.
# -   It essentially disables any form of authentication check, meaning both authenticated and unauthenticated users have full access.
# -   Used when you want to make a view open to all users, without requiring authentication.
